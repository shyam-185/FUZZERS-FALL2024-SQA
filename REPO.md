### Project Overview
The goal of this project was to piece together all of skills that we have learned through this semester's SQA workshops. Through the use of git hook, fuzzing, forensic logging, and continuous integration, our team was able to esnure that we can implement, test, and find errors within a set of code.

### Activities

#### 4.a. Git Hook
- A Git Hook was created to automatically scan for security weaknesses in the project whenever a Python file is modified and committed.

#### 4.b. Fuzzing
- The `fuzz.py` script was implemented to test five  Python methods of our choosing. The goal of this was to have any bugs that were caught reported and for scans to be run through GitHub Actions.

#### 4.c. Forensic Logging
- Forensic logging was added to five methods:
  1. `giveTimeStamp` in `main.py` logs the execution of the timestamp function.
  2. `getDataLoadCount` in `lint_engine.py` logs file analysis activities.
  3. `checkLoggingPerData` in `py_parser.py` logs checks for data-related logging.
  4. Additional methods were identified and modified for meaningful forensic logs.
  5. Logging follows Pythonâ€™s `logging` module for standardization and ease of use.

#### 4.d. Continuous Integration
- A GitHub Actions pipeline was implemented to scan all of the code for bugs and security weaknesses.

### Lessons Learned
- Integrating forensic logging can significantly improve traceability and debugging efforts.
- Fuzz testing is a great approach to find bugs and unexpected problems throughout the coding process.
- Continuous integration ensures code quality and reduces the time that manual testing would take.

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates a practical application of software quality assurance techniques, allowing us to work together as a team to ensure that our final product picked up as many bugs and security flaws as possible.
